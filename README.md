# 👋 Hey, I'm Nikhil!

💡 I love building cool stuff on the web — from sleek **frontends** that look great ✨ to powerful **backends** that just work ⚡.  
Whether it’s coding with **React, Next js, Preact, Tailwind, and JavaScript** for smooth UIs, or diving into **Python, Java, .NET, Go, APIs, and databases** for the heavy lifting, I enjoy making ideas come alive.  

I also work with **Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, and DevOps pipelines** to get projects from code → cloud ☁️ without the headaches.  
And yes, I like sprinkling in **AI and automation** 🤖 whenever I can to make apps a little smarter.  

🌱 Always open to learning, collaborating, and building something fun & impactful together.  
If you’re working on something exciting, let’s connect — I’d love to team up! 🚀
